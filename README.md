# Leroys's Connect 4
This project is an implementation in JavaScript of the algorithm [minimax with Alpha-Beta] and [negamax with Alpha-Beta] applied to the game "Connect Four". It features a robust AI that can challenge both novice and experienced players, providing a dynamic gaming experience. This project also incorporates a gesture recognition technology to allow players to control the game using physical gestures.

# Example

And here the unfinished 3D-Version: https://web-app-server.de/leroys-connect-4-3d/

# How it works
The AI determines the optimal move using either the minimax or negamax algorithm, both of which are enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning to improve efficiency. These algorithms simulate possible moves in the game up to a certain depth and evaluate the game board at each node using a heuristic analysis.

By integrating these algorithms, the AI efficiently analyzes potential moves and counters, making it a challenging opponent. The game can be controlled through a gesture recognition technology, allowing the players to interact with the game.
